## Amazon Book Search SE

This allows you to find books on amazon through their Product Advertising API. 
It is a simplified version of amazon-book-search (does not provide express middleware interface). 
This version does not humanize the results and returns them in original Amazon format. Works
well searching by ISBN as well as keywords.

### Install

     $ npm install amazon-book-search-se

### Requirements
    You will need an Amazon API key, secret and associate ID to use this service. For more information,
    look at the Amazon Product Advertising API documentation.

    var amazonBookSearchSE = require('amazon-book-search-se');
    var absse =  new amazonBookSearchSE({ awsKey: "YOUR KEY", awsSecret: "YOUR SECRET", assocId: "YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG" });

    // search by ISBN
    absse.search('9781413027570', function(error, result){
        if(error){
            console.log(error);
        } else {
            console.log(result);
        }
    });

    // search by title - first page of 10 results
    absse.search('catcher in the rye', function(error, result){
        if(error){
            console.log(error);
        } else {
            console.log(result);
        }
    }, 1);

    // search by title - second page of 10 results
    absse.search('catcher in the rye', function(error, result){
        if(error){
            console.log(error);
        } else {
            console.log(result);
        }
    }, 2);

There is a maximum of 10 pages returned by Amazon so only 100 products will be displayed.
